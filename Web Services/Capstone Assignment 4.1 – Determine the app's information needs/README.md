## How to Determine the app's information needs
We want to have all the application’s saved data stored remotely, so that users can share information across their devices. In order to do this, we will have to decide what data we want stored and how we want to store it for the app to continue functioning properly.

Review the application provided. While you review the code, determine which classes need their variables to be stored remotely.

Once you have identified what needs to be stored, create a small UML Class Diagram to show which data should be stored. You only have to include the classes and corresponding attributes that will have data stored remotely. You shouldn’t have to include every class in the app. It is okay to leave methods out of the diagram for the purpose of this assignment.
